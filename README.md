Determining the Predictive Accuracy of Machine Learning Models for Diagnosing Diabetes from Fundus Images

The Code Sturcture is setup in a self-explanatory manner such that the datasets are explored in the DataExploration folder,
the trained models are stored in the Models folder and the preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, testing and validating is
in the Src Folder (under their respective subfolders). 
Everything for the Web Interface is housed within the InvestigationApp folder. This contains a backend and a frontend folder to ensure concerns were compeletely seperated for easier understanding of the code.
